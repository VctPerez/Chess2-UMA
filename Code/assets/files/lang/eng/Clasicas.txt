 Classic Pawn:
   The pawn moves vertically
  through its column, and cannot
  go backwards, and captures diagonally.
 
 Classic Bishop:
   Walks diagonally one or more tiles
  up to the closest captured tile.
  
 Classic Knight:
   The knight is the only piece on the board
  that can jump over other pieces.
  
   The knight moves two tiles vertically
  or horizontally and one more
  perpendicularly.
  The knight's move looks like an "L".
  
 Classic Rook:
   Moves in straight lines in the lines and
  columns of the board, but cannot move
  over other pieces.
  
   Additionally, if it has not been moved
   yet, one rook may castle with the king.
   
 Classic Queen:
   The queen moves any amount of tiles
  vertically, horizontally or diagonally
  in a straight line. In other words,
  like a rook and a bishop combined.
  
 Classic King:
   The king may move to any adjacent tile.
   
   It may not move to a tile threatened by
  an enemy piece, and is the only piece that
  must be protected, limiting other pieces
  movement.

Random Piece
Inicially behaves like a pawn,
but, every time it moves it changes
to other random piece from the 
classic pieces except the king.
